let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 is a Statement where I am reassigning the value of the count variable, = is an 
// assignment operator where right hand side value i.e, 1(0+1) is assigned to a variable count.
